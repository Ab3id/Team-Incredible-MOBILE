MedBuzz is an Android application built mainly focusing on people who need timely medication. 

This reminder application helps to aid the forgetful and busy with remembering to take their daily medications.

It is designed to help users keep track of their medication schedule and ensure that each medication is completed within a period of time as prescribed by their doctor.


## Basic Functionality 

This app is designed with a clean UI and an interactive user experience whereby the user is allowed to Create a list of pill objects for a new schedule, Update the list, Retrieve content previously stored from the pills list and also Delete from the list of pills after completion. 

It notifies the user at the said time through a chime sound and alert of which medication to take along with the dosage.

The user receives a push notification when he/she misses the reminder while offline and the medication is marked as missed.
